# HandsUp
Get it? Because it freezes your computer!


## DO NOT RUN WITHOUT READING THIS

This program is similar to Matrix.bat with a few exceptions... it kills your computer.
<br>Not actually though. It's just a nuisance

Runs Matrix.bat but will open itself up constantly preventing manual shutdown of the program and you won't be able to use anything on the computer
<br>Caused school computer to slow down in a minute >:D (School computers are pretty bad)

### You'll need to right-click the file and press edit before you can use it. There is further explanation in the program.

Can be used for trolling others or when you're bored
